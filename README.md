# 🚗 Smart Vehicle Performance System (SVPS)

The **Smart Vehicle Performance System (SVPS)** is an intelligent and cloud-integrated vehicle monitoring and optimization platform. It is designed to elevate vehicle performance, enhance driver safety, and promote environmental sustainability by offering real-time data insights and predictive analytics.

SVPS leverages sensor data to track key vehicle metrics such as speed, fuel consumption, tire pressure, and engine performance. This data is analyzed and relayed to the driver through a mobile application and driver dashboard to encourage fuel-efficient, safe, and cost-effective driving habits.

## 🎯 Project Objectives & Scope

SVPS is designed to tackle pressing automotive issues including rising fuel costs, vehicle breakdowns, and road accidents. Here are the primary objectives and goals of the system:

### 1. Reduction in Fuel Consumption
- Utilizes GPS and route optimization algorithms to recommend the most fuel-efficient paths.
- Tracks hard acceleration, idling, and braking to provide feedback for eco-friendly driving.
- **Target**: 25% reduction in fuel consumption within the first 6 months.

### 2. Reduction in Road Accidents
- Detects unsafe behaviors such as texting while driving or overspeeding.
- Issues visual and audio alerts to improve driver awareness.
- **Target**: 30% reduction in road-side accidents in the first year.

### 3. Data Monitoring and Predictive Insights
- Continuously collects real-time driving data and vehicle health stats.
- Provides maintenance alerts and predictive diagnostics based on vehicle condition and driving behavior.

### 4. Maximizing User Engagement
- Offers a personalized driving dashboard with actionable feedback.
- Features an intuitive and friendly mobile user interface.
- **Target**: 40% increase in user engagement within 6 months.

### 5. User Confidentiality and Security
- All collected data is stored and processed in a secure cloud infrastructure.
- Complies with the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA).
- Implements strict cybersecurity protocols to ensure data privacy.
